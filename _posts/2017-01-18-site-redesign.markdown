*Project 52 - My good friend [Desmond](http://designxdesmond.com/) and I are doing a project 52 where each of us complete a project in our respective fields to sharpen our skills and hold each other accountable. **This is week 2**.* 

***

This week I began a site redesign and merge. I wanted to find a way combine my photo portfolio with my code blog. The entire project is split in two. This week I focused on design and planning and next week I will code the site. 


Objective: 

* Come up with a design that accommodates my blog, code, and photography
* create digital wireframe
* gather content and assets 
* plan for the second portion of the project

### Project 2 checklist: 

[X] gather and edit content
[x] complete digital wire frame 
[x] chose prototype tools 
[ ] choose  css structure 
[ ] choose fonts, color, and copy chosen and complete 

### Assets and content

#### Code 

[x] 1. js calculator

	as an aspiring developer, sometimes I phone in design. It uses a different part of my brain. I spent days on a code project just to put a quick and dirty (often ugly) face on it. I am realizing the importance of design and user interface although I am still bad at it. I am now considering font and color chooses as a real part of my project.

#### Refactoring code 

I revisited the some of the code of that I've done in the past so that I could be happy about what I was displaying on my new an improving site. Here is what I learned from refactoring code: 

#### Content management 

My previous photography was on WordPress. I ever got into.... Here is how I am managing content now. 

#### Using Adobe XD to digital wire frame 

This was my first experience with Adobe XD and I thought it was pleasant. I have some experience with other Adobe products but I am a novice at best using them. The learning curve with this app is far less steeper than other Adobe products I've tried. It made putting my sketch into life very easy and fun.
