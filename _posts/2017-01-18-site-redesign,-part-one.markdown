*Project 52 - My good friend [Desmond](http://designxdesmond.com/) and I are doing a project 52 where each of us complete a project in our respective fields to sharpen our skills and hold each other accountable. **This is week 2**.* 

***

This week I began a site redesign and merge. I wanted to find a way combine my photo portfolio with my code blog. The entire project is split in two. This week I focused on design and planning and next week I will code the site. 


### Objective:  

* Come up with a design that accommodates my blog, code, and photography
* create digital wireframe
* gather content and assets 
* plan for the second portion of the project

*Here is a screenshot of the [digital wireframe](https://xd.adobe.com/view/4c16a858-de09-45fc-a523-12f63a443153/):*

### Lessons learned: 

#### Using Adobe XD to digital wire frame 

This was my first experience with Adobe XD and I thought it was pleasant. I have some experience with other Adobe products but I am a novice. Adobe XD is very user-friendly with little learning curve. It made putting my sketch into life very easy and fun.

#### Refactoring code 

I revisited the some of the code of that I've done in the past so that I'd be happy with what I am displaying on my new site. Here is what I learned from refactoring code: 
	
#### Content management (on Jekyll):

My current photography is maintained on WordPress so the several gigs of photos I have are stored in a database.

Managing large files on Jekyll is different. Right now, while I don't have many files, I can easily store photos at normal size in an assets folder in the project. I am still researching how to handle several large files in the future.
