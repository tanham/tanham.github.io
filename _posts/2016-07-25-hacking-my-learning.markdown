I had to hack my learning. Over the past few weeks, I found that I wasn't picking up JavaScript very with fCC. I got bored with tutorials and I figured out a pattern to solving problems by imitation rather then thinking through it. I am naturally a corner cutter (a hacker even) and so without the fundamental understanding I flew through the material with patterns I picked up solving the easy stuff. This is just how I operate. 

In addition to fCC, I tried Codecademy, reading the eloquent JavaScript book, looking at MDN and other online books and resources. Some stuff was boring and other stuff was incredibly dense. 

I recently had an 'aha' moment when my RC start mentor walked me through building a JavaScript image slider using Codepen and screen-casting. As she built the slider, I listened to her talk her way through why she did things. I am comfortable with JavaScript syntax but I usually get caught up in thinking computationally. It helped so much to hear her talk through her process. 
   
Are following along with a few different tutorials, I am beginning to understand what's most important to my learning. I need a fundamental understanding of concepts and I need interactive examples.

I share this because everyone's learning style is different and I having the self-awareness to learn yours can save you a lot of trouble.
