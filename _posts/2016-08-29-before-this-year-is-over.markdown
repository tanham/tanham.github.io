I began learning to code about 3 months ago. I have come amazingly far from not knowing exactly what computer programming was a year ago to today. 

Here is what I would like to work on before 2016 is over

# I want to be a Javascript ninja

Right now, I know enough JavaScript to be dangerous. I can write small programs and solve simple algorithms but anything bigger and I am off in Google land trying to figure out what I have gotten myself into. Here are some of the JS projects that I have worked on so far: 

* [JS Rocket](https://tanham.github.io/js-rocket/rocket.html) 
* [Random Quote Generator](http://codepen.io/tanham2122/pen/WxzBgE)
* [Local Weather app](http://codepen.io/tanham2122/pen/kXJQzK)
* [JS Calculator]()
* [To Do List App]()

I realize that a few months is not enough time to become a JS expert but I plan to deeply study the fundamentals of Javascript and how it works while writing an absurb amount of code. By the end of the year, I would like to have confidence that I can solve most things with Javascript. 

My plan of attack is simple: write code, read code, read books, and talk JS. 

Goals
* Write code - write at least one JS app each week, write JS daily
* Read code -  Periodically read Javascript code (maybe in a pair or group?)
* Reading list - Think Like a Programmer, Eloquent Javascript, You Don't Know JS, Javascript: The Good Parts, (I am taking suggestions)
* Talk JS - Ask questions, pontificate, teach what I know, etc. 

# I want to build a body of art work using code

I love art. I also love the idea using code to make art. CSS animation, image processing and other generative art fascinates me. I would like to spend time digging deeper into this kind of programming and making some of my own. 

Goals: 
* Create 3-5 pieces of art with code 
* Design and program a computer game

# Build an app

I would like to build an app keeps tracks of several kinds personal data in one place(i.e health metrics, finances, daily log, stress levels, food intake, etc.). On any given day, I would like to be able to analyze any week's or month's personal data to find areas of self-improvement.

This is an extension of a self-experiment that I have been working on for some time. When I put all the important metrics in one place, I always find ways I can improve my quality of life so I would like to use software to help. 

# I would also like to: 

* find a community 
* contribute to Open Source 
* feel confident when introducing myself as a web developer
