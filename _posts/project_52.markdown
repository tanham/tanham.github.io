To kick this year off, my best friend [Desmond]() and I challenged each other to a Project 52. Our purpose is to sharpen our skills in our respective fields while holding one another accountable. This is a living document that will keep track of our progress. 

I am focusing on building my coding and computer programming skills and Desmond is focusing on illustration and animation.

#### Guidelines

1. Create and submit a project in chosen field every week for 52 weeks
2. If we miss a week there is a monetary consequence (we agreed on an amount required to give up)
3. Every 4-6 weeks we will collaborate on a project to shake things up
