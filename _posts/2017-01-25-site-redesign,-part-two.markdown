*Project 52 - My good friend [Desmond](http://designxdesmond.com/) and I are doing a project 52 where each of us complete a project in our respective fields to sharpen our skills and hold each other accountable. **This is week 3**.*

This week I attempted to code the design I created for my new site. I ran into some issues along the way and I wanted to detail them here. 

I started to prototype the design using [bootstrap](getbootstrap.com/). When I laid the the basic structure down I realized I didn't like the way it looked in the browser. I learned that my design in Adobe XD is in a different layout than the browse is so it does not look the same. The dimensions are feel too big for the browser and the layout seemed too spread out for the content that I have. Because I am not much of a designer, I think I should break this project down even further and enlist some help. 

I decided to use SASS and [OOCSS](oocss.org/) for this project but I am still wrapping my head around how to structure my stylesheets. 

My next steps for this project is to attempt a redesign with different dimensions, build out some of the features I want to include, and start thinking about how to structure stylesheets. 

I will work on this redesign as an ongoing project instead of a weekly project.
