Title: "30 Days of Javascript"
date: 2016-11-20
Category: Code

Tomorrow is my birthday and I'd like to give myself the gift of a challenge. 

For the next 30 days, I will attempt to complete 30 Javascript projects. 

The guidelines: 

- [ ] 30 Javascript projects pushed to Github by December 20th
- [ ] Ideally, one project per day but if I get behind, try to catch up before end date
- [ ] Ask for help when needed
- [ ] Projects should be a mix of small, medium, and large (I will get more specific soon)

Here goes nothing...
