Title: "Code Goals"

I wanted to create a public record my goals and learning strategy to hold myself accountable and to share more of my journey. I don't know if this is the most effective way of learning but it's my way. To help measure my progress I will keep this page active by adding links to my code and sharing adjustments that I make. Here are the 5 things that I am focusing on over the next three months: 

### Building stuff

* Portfolio Site 
* CSS animation 
* Vanilla Javascript features
* Jekyll themes  
* Codepen reference pens 


### Deep Learning (Front-end Resources)

* [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/tanham21)
* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) 
* [EMCAscript standard](http://www.ecmascript.org/docs.php)
* [Front End Handbook pdf](https://www.gitbook.com/book/frontendmasters/front-end-handbook/details)


### Writing 

I have a goal to post at least weekly to this blog. I'd like to write about things that I have learned, problems that I encounter and other tech related (and non-related) things. 

### Community 

For the most part I am learning alone, just me and my computer. Because I am currently traveling, language barriers and location make it so I am rarely able to attend meetups or meet other Devs in real life. To hack this I am apart of a few online groups that focus on creating community for people like me. I am also apart of Recurse center's [RC start program](https://www.recurse.com/blog/99-free-one-on-one-mentorship-for-new-programmers) so I have access to a mentor and that community. 

I am still learning how to use this communities as resources and help wherever I can but I'd like to make this a big part of my learning and overall coding journey.  

### Open Source 

I am very interested in Open Source. I've already benefited tremendously from OSS and I would like to contribute. I believe in making technology accessible and I think it is a great way to give back to a community that has already taught me so much. Over the next three months I will pick an open source project to contribute to regularly. I will updated this post with my progress.
