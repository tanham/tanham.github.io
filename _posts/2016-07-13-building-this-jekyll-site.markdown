### Inspiration 

Designing and building a new website for myself was the reason that I wanted to learn to code. I was so fed up with the free resources available to me (an at the time non-techie) and I wanted to learn to make my own website. I had no idea that I'd get so into it, but here I am. 

### Wire framing 
   
I’m new to designing websites but I know what I like. I watched a few youtube videos about wire framing, with hopes of understanding the thought processes behind design and what things to take note of in the beginning. I kept my eyes open as I perused the web for designs that I liked and then I sketched a several designs over a few days. I nixed several ideas (some that I still like) because I just wasn’t sure. While learning something new in a self-directed environment sometimes difficult to know the right way to go. At this point, many of my ideas are a remix of some of the things that I admire online.


### Prototyping in Codepen

I coded 3 iterations of my design in Codepen to prototype. I like Codepen for it’s auto preview feature. I thought it might be nice to immediately see how my code came to life - and it was. I chose to use Bootstrap and Flexbox to create my layout fast. I already feel a few limitations here...


### Resources

I had plenty help every step of the way. For wire framing I watched a video from [DevTip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQO47_AP6lo) and bits and pieces of others to try to put myself on the right track. 

[Lil Chen's site redesign article](http://lilchen.com/blog/site-redesign-process/) was such a big help in having a peek into how someone more experience may go about the process. 

I also read about writing clean and modular code with [BEM](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) and [OOCSS](https://toddmotto.com/getting-started-with-object-orientated-css-oocss-creating-a-button-kit/). 

[Learn layout](http://learnlayout.com/) was a good help for some CSS refreshers.

Oh and [Minimum viable product](http://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp). 

I can't say that I have hard fast followed any of these things I have to remind myself of the things that I learn and want to adopt at every turn but they serve as good jumping off points. 


### Enter Jekyll

I downloaded and ran jekyll for the first time with the help of their amazing documentation - https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/. I decided to use the default Jekyll them as a starting point. I ran into several problems that I am still working out and in retrospect I should have began with a clean slate but working the kinks was a tremedous learning experience. 

To be continued...
