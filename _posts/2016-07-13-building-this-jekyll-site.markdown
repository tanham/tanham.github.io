### Inspiration 

Designing and building a new website for myself was the reason that I wanted to learn to code. I was so fed up with the free resources available to me (an at the time non-techie) and I wanted to learn to make my own website. I had no idea that I'd get so into it, but here I am. 

### Wire framing 
   
I’m new to designing websites but I know what I like. I watched a few Youtube videos about wire framing, with hopes of understanding some of the thought processes behind the practice and what things to take note of in the beginning. I kept my eyes open as I perused the web for designs that I liked and then I sketched a several designs over a few days. I nixed most of my initial ideas (some that I still like) because I didn't think I could get it to work in the browser or because they were just bad. At this point, many of my ideas are a remix of some of the things that I admire online.


### Prototyping in Codepen

I coded 3 iterations of my design in Codepen to prototype. I like Codepen for it’s auto preview feature. I thought it might be nice to immediately see how my code came to life - and it was. I chose to use Bootstrap to create my layout fast. Here is one iteration of the design: 

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="vKJOzQ" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="tanham2122" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/tanham2122/pen/vKJOzQ/">vKJOzQ</a> by Tanisha Hampden (<a href="http://codepen.io/tanham2122">@tanham2122</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

### Resources

I had plenty help every step of the way. For wire framing I watched a video from [DevTip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQO47_AP6lo) and bits and pieces from others to try to put myself on the right track. 

[Lil Chen's site redesign article](http://lilchen.com/blog/site-redesign-process/) was such a big help in having a peek into how someone more experienced may go about the process. 

I also read about writing clean and modular code with [BEM](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) and [OOCSS](https://toddmotto.com/getting-started-with-object-orientated-css-oocss-creating-a-button-kit/). 

[Learn layout](http://learnlayout.com/) was a good help for some CSS refreshers.

Oh and [Minimum viable product](http://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp). 

I can't say that I have hard fast followed any of these things. I have to remind myself of the things that I learn and want to adopt at every turn but they serve as good jumping off points. I will say that at some point I had to stop trying to take advice and just code. The resources were great to get me started but I had to dig in before analysis paralysis set in. 


### Enter Jekyll

I downloaded and ran Jekyll for the first time with the help of their amazing [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/). I decided to use the default Jekyll theme as a starting point. I ran into several problems that I am still working out and in retrospect I should have began with a clean slate but working the kinks was a tremendous learning experience. 


One problem that I had was using vanilla CSS instead of Sass. The default Jekyll theme comes with Sass styling. I pasted my CSS into a new file and added to the project - the Sass styling and my CSS was competing with each other. I liked some of the Sass styling but I ended up deleting the entire Sass files so I can have full control. 

I am still learning Jekyll and I'm constantly amazed by how powerful it is. My design and overall website will continue to evolve as I learn and experiment more.
