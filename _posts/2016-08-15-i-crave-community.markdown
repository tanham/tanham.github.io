I crave community. 

For the past eight months, I have been traveling all around Europe, searching for my community. I have been to England, Spain, Italy, France, and Ireland and in each place I have found what I like to call the 5-percenters. People who beleive in pursuing dreams and travel and living life as loudly as possible. People who chose not to judge based on silly things like skin color and sexual orientation. People who actually want to know who you are. It's been transformative. I've learned so much about this part of the world. I have so much more to learn. 

The most important lesson so far is that the most effective way to learn something is to surround myself with others who are just as passionate (about that something) as I am. 

Now I am looking for my code community. I am looking for people who love to code. I'd love to find those who may look a bit different than the traditional web developer. I'd love to spend hours a day with my new code community, working out problems and coming up with new ways of doing things. I'd love to dive right into the deep end and code. 

The search begins...
