### Javascript is hard

I've gone through several hours of tutorials on freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, and on Youtube. I have been through a few real life examples with my mentor, I have copied and pasted code, and I've read through books. None of it really stuck. I had to put it down for a while and focus on building things I was more comfortable with (like this Jekyll site) out of pure frustration. Today I decided to have another go at it but I couldn't bear another dull tutorial so I tried a 2 and a half hour Skillshare course that promised I would be able to build a launching rocket with Javascript by the end. I dug in and low and behold about 4 hours later I had an interactive rocket that I built with Javascript. 

[Here](https://tanham21.github.io/js-rocket/rocket.html) is my JS rocket! 

While building the rocket, I picked up some nifty chrome developer tools tricks and I learned a bit about css animation. This project was so improtant to my learning JS and I really should have done it sooner. Learning Javascript (or perhaps any language) can be difficult and small wins mean so much in the beginning. I now have better understanding of how I can use Javascript to manipulate things in the browser and how I can combine it with html and css to make magic.
