        <title>Code Goals</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to create a public record my goals and learning strategy to hold myself accountable and to share more of my journey. I don’t know if this is the most effective way of learning but it’s my way. To help measure my progress I will keep this page active by adding links to my code and sharing adjustments that I make. Here are the 5 things that I am focusing on over the next three months:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-stuff&quot;&gt;Building stuff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Portfolio Site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CSS animation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vanilla Javascript features&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jekyll themes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Codepen reference pens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deep-learning-front-end-resources&quot;&gt;Deep Learning (Front-end Resources)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.com/tanham21&quot;&gt;freeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/&quot;&gt;Mozilla Developer Network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecmascript.org/docs.php&quot;&gt;EMCAscript standard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gitbook.com/book/frontendmasters/front-end-handbook/details&quot;&gt;Front End Handbook pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;writing&quot;&gt;Writing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a goal to post at least weekly to this blog. I’d like to write about things that I have learned, problems that I encounter and other tech related (and non-related) things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;community&quot;&gt;Community&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part I am learning alone, just me and my computer. Because I am currently traveling, language barriers and location make it so I am rarely able to attend meetups or meet other Devs in real life. To hack this I am apart of a few online groups that focus on creating community for people like me. I am also apart of Recurse center’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recurse.com/blog/99-free-one-on-one-mentorship-for-new-programmers&quot;&gt;RC start program&lt;/a&gt; so I have access to a mentor and that community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still learning how to use this communities as resources and help wherever I can but I’d like to make this a big part of my learning and overall coding journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-source&quot;&gt;Open Source&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very interested in Open Source. I’ve already benefited tremendously from OSS and I would like to contribute. I believe in making technology accessible and I think it is a great way to give back to a community that has already taught me so much. Over the next three months I will pick an open source project to contribute to regularly. I will updated this post with my progress.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Building This Jekyll Site</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;inspiration&quot;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing and building a new website for myself was the reason that I wanted to learn to code. I was so fed up with the free resources available to me (an at the time non-techie) and I wanted to learn to make my own website. I had no idea that I’d get so into it, but here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wire-framing&quot;&gt;Wire framing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m new to designing websites but I know what I like. I watched a few Youtube videos about wire framing, with hopes of understanding some of the thought processes behind the practice and what things to take note of in the beginning. I kept my eyes open as I perused the web for designs that I liked and then I sketched a several designs over a few days. I nixed most of my initial ideas (some that I still like) because I didn’t think I could get it to work in the browser or because they were just bad. At this point, many of my ideas are a remix of some of the things that I admire online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prototyping-in-codepen&quot;&gt;Prototyping in Codepen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I coded 3 iterations of my design in Codepen to prototype. I like Codepen for it’s auto preview feature. I thought it might be nice to immediately see how my code came to life - and it was. I chose to use Bootstrap to create my layout fast. Here is one iteration of the design:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-height=&quot;265&quot; data-theme-id=&quot;0&quot; data-slug-hash=&quot;vKJOzQ&quot; data-default-tab=&quot;html,result&quot; data-user=&quot;tanham2122&quot; data-embed-version=&quot;2&quot; class=&quot;codepen&quot;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/tanham2122/pen/vKJOzQ/&quot;&gt;vKJOzQ&lt;/a&gt; by Tanisha Hampden (&lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/tanham2122&quot;&gt;@tanham2122&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io&quot;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had plenty help every step of the way. For wire framing I watched a video from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQO47_AP6lo&quot;&gt;DevTip&lt;/a&gt; and bits and pieces from others to try to put myself on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lilchen.com/blog/site-redesign-process/&quot;&gt;Lil Chen’s site redesign article&lt;/a&gt; was such a big help in having a peek into how someone more experienced may go about the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also read about writing clean and modular code with &lt;a href=&quot;http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/&quot;&gt;BEM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://toddmotto.com/getting-started-with-object-orientated-css-oocss-creating-a-button-kit/&quot;&gt;OOCSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://learnlayout.com/&quot;&gt;Learn layout&lt;/a&gt; was a good help for some CSS refreshers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp&quot;&gt;Minimum viable product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t say that I have hard fast followed any of these things I have to remind myself of the things that I learn and want to adopt at every turn but they serve as good jumping off points. I will say that at some point I had to stop trying to take advice and just code. The resources were great to get me started but I had to dig in before analysis paralysis set in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enter-jekyll&quot;&gt;Enter Jekyll&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I downloaded and ran Jekyll for the first time with the help of their amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to use the default Jekyll theme as a starting point. I ran into several problems that I am still working out and in retrospect I should have began with a clean slate but working the kinks was a tremendous learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem that I had was using vanilla CSS instead of Sass. The default Jekyll theme comes with Sass styling. I pasted my CSS into a new file and added to the project - the Sass styling and my CSS was competing with each other. I liked some of the Sass styling but I ended up deleting the entire Sass files so I can have full control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still learning Jekyll and I’m constantly amazed by how powerful it is. My design and overall website will continue to evolve as I learn and experiment more.&lt;/p&gt;
