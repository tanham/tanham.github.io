        <title>Date Generator</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Project 52 - My good friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://designxdesmond.com/&quot;&gt;Desmond&lt;/a&gt; and I are doing a project 52 where each of us complete a project in our respective fields to sharpen our skills and hold each other accountable. &lt;strong&gt;This is week 4&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am four weeks late with this project due to travel and personal reasons. No excuses though! In the terms of our Project 52, we must pay $5 for each week we are late and make up for missed projects so I am adding 4 weeks to the end of the project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few weeks, I have been working on a [romantic or friendly] date generator. I came up with this because I wanted to make plans to go out with a new friend but I was unsure of what they liked so I made a list of various activities and used a little JavaScript to allow a user to choose date activities based on their interests/budget/time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;first-implementation&quot;&gt;First Implementation:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and easiest implementation I could think of was to create a array of date ideas and on the click of a button display a random activity. I used the built-in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/code&gt; object to return a random integer to randomly choose an activity on each click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See first implementation below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-height=&quot;376&quot; data-theme-id=&quot;0&quot; data-slug-hash=&quot;GrxzXr&quot; data-default-tab=&quot;result&quot; data-user=&quot;tanham2122&quot; data-embed-version=&quot;2&quot; data-pen-title=&quot;Date-Gen-1&quot; class=&quot;codepen&quot;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/tanham2122/pen/GrxzXr/&quot;&gt;Date-Gen-1&lt;/a&gt; by Tanisha Hampden (&lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/tanham2122&quot;&gt;@tanham2122&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io&quot;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;second-implementation&quot;&gt;Second Implementation:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to add the option to choose a date by category or type. I made a button for each category and upon clicking, the user would get back results relevant to their choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I began to code this implementation, I put all the date ideas into spreadsheet, tagged with the different categories (i.e active, dinner, budget, etc.). I then coded a JSON object with each date idea and corresponding category and accessed the information with dot notation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I began writing the JavaScript for this project, I hard coded a JSON object that contained date ideas and their corresponding category. This was tedious and messy. I thought to myself, it would be cool it there are an API that allowed me to access my own data in the spreadsheet that I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I Googled it and there it was. &lt;a href=&quot;http://airtable.com&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/a&gt; (the spreadsheet software I used) generates an API for each table you create. I am able to create, read, update, and destroy records using the Airtable API. So far I have made successful API calls and I have access to all of the date records that I input into the tables. The repository that contains the code for this app is private because I haven’t figured out how to hide my API key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is interesting about building this project is that is was a dance between how to structure the user interface with the functionality. I couldn’t dive into the code without considering the end user because I initially had little concept of what the user would need/want. For example, I tried to include a variety of budget options and activities of different time frames in each category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, I will share my progress on this app as well as a proper demo.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Site Redesign, Part Two</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Project 52 - My good friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://designxdesmond.com/&quot;&gt;Desmond&lt;/a&gt; and I are doing a project 52 where each of us complete a project in our respective fields to sharpen our skills and hold each other accountable. &lt;strong&gt;This is week 3&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I attempted to code the design I created for my new site. I ran into some issues along the way and I wanted to detail them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to prototype the design using &lt;a href=&quot;getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;. When I laid the the basic structure down I realized I didn’t like the way it looked in the browser. I learned that my design in Adobe XD is in a different layout than the browse is so it does not look the same. The dimensions are feel too big for the browser and the layout seemed too spread out for the content that I have. Because I am not much of a designer, I think I should break this project down even further and enlist some help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to use SASS and &lt;a href=&quot;oocss.org/&quot;&gt;OOCSS&lt;/a&gt; for this project but I am still wrapping my head around how to structure my stylesheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next steps for this project is to attempt a redesign with different dimensions, build out some of the features I want to include, and start thinking about how to structure stylesheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will work on this redesign as an ongoing project instead of a weekly project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I began a site redesign and merge. I wanted to find a way combine my photo portfolio with my code blog. The entire project is split in two. This week I focused on design and planning and next week I will code the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;objective&quot;&gt;Objective:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Come up with a design that accommodates my blog, code, and photography&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create digital wireframe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gather content and assets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;plan for the second portion of the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here is a screenshot of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://xd.adobe.com/view/4c16a858-de09-45fc-a523-12f63a443153/&quot;&gt;digital wireframe&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;using-adobe-xd-to-digital-wire-frame&quot;&gt;Using Adobe XD to digital wire frame&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first experience with Adobe XD and I thought it was pleasant. I have some experience with other Adobe products but I am a novice. Adobe XD is very user-friendly with little learning curve. It made putting my sketch into life very easy and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;refactoring-code&quot;&gt;Refactoring code&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I revisited the some of the code of that I’ve done in the past so that I’d be happy with what I am displaying on my new site. Here is what I learned from refactoring code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;content-management-on-jekyll&quot;&gt;Content management (on Jekyll):&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current photography is maintained on WordPress so the several gigs of photos I have are stored in a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing large files on Jekyll is different. Right now, while I don’t have many files, I can easily store photos at normal size in an assets folder in the project. I am still researching how to handle several large files in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Three Javascript Calculators</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Project 52 - My good friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://designxdesmond.com/&quot;&gt;Desmond&lt;/a&gt; and I are doing a project 52 where each of us complete a project in our respective fields to sharpen our skills and hold each other accountable. &lt;strong&gt;This is week 1&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implementations-of-a-simple-js-calculator&quot;&gt;3 Implementations of a simple JS Calculator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;simple-js-calc-1&quot;&gt;Simple JS Calc 1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest possible implementation I could think of was to include two input fields and the four operands buttons. The result comes up in an alert dialog box. Each input and operand has a function that is triggered in an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;onclick&lt;/code&gt; event. The code is self-contained in one document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-height=&quot;265&quot; data-theme-id=&quot;0&quot; data-slug-hash=&quot;QdNKWa&quot; data-default-tab=&quot;result&quot; data-user=&quot;tanham2122&quot; data-embed-version=&quot;2&quot; data-pen-title=&quot;Simple JS Calculator 1 &quot; class=&quot;codepen&quot;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/tanham2122/pen/QdNKWa/&quot;&gt;Simple JS Calculator 1 &lt;/a&gt; by Tanisha Hampden (&lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/tanham2122&quot;&gt;@tanham2122&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io&quot;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;simple-js-calc-2&quot;&gt;Simple JS Calc 2&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next calculator uses a HTML form and only one JavaScript function. This calculator looks nicer to the user but the code is very ugly as it is also self-contained in one HTML document. This calculator also uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;onclick&lt;/code&gt; events to fire a function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-height=&quot;265&quot; data-theme-id=&quot;0&quot; data-slug-hash=&quot;xgVEGo&quot; data-default-tab=&quot;result&quot; data-user=&quot;tanham2122&quot; data-embed-version=&quot;2&quot; data-pen-title=&quot;Simple JS Calculator 2&quot; class=&quot;codepen&quot;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/tanham2122/pen/xgVEGo/&quot;&gt;Simple JS Calculator 2&lt;/a&gt; by Tanisha Hampden (&lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/tanham2122&quot;&gt;@tanham2122&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io&quot;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;simple-js-calc-3&quot;&gt;Simple JS Calc 3&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the best and most programmatic version of the calculator I have so far. The code is clean and the interface looks good. (I found a calculator design online and tweaked in to my liking).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loop through the buttons to add an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;onclick&lt;/code&gt; event for each. Within the loop there is a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; that states the possibly cases and triggers a function based on what cases is being clicked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one bug that I know of so far. Once an equation is calculated, you can continue to add number to the result. I will keep working on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-height=&quot;265&quot; data-theme-id=&quot;0&quot; data-slug-hash=&quot;pRyEEO&quot; data-default-tab=&quot;result&quot; data-user=&quot;tanham2122&quot; data-embed-version=&quot;2&quot; data-pen-title=&quot;Simple JS Calculator 3 &quot; class=&quot;codepen&quot;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/tanham2122/pen/pRyEEO/&quot;&gt;Simple JS Calculator 3 &lt;/a&gt; by Tanisha Hampden (&lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/tanham2122&quot;&gt;@tanham2122&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io&quot;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consistency - For me, consistency is so important to my continued growth. Even if I code just 30 minutes a everyday, the output and what I learn is so much more significant if I have gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seeing a project through - This project was something that I started about a month ago but got distracted and stopped working on it. It felt so good to complete this project. Seeing a project through gives you confidence that you know you can do it but more importantly you get a chance to experience all the challenges that come with that project and practice at debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The importance of accountability - One of the main purposes for the Project 52 is to force accountability onto myself. If I had not agreed to this project with my friend Desmond I may have never finished this calculator project. I certainty would not have finished it this week. Now I am ready to move on to the next thing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Building A Wikipedia Viewer</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-i-learned-from-building-a-wikipedia-viewer&quot;&gt;What I learned from building a Wikipedia Viewer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not at all a tutorial but a reflection of the things that I learned and the problems I faced while building a Wikipedia viewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;event-handlers&quot;&gt;Event Handlers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow I got into the habit of adding &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;onclick&lt;/code&gt; events to html files. This works fine but my mentor mentioned that it’s better practice to keep all of your Javascript self-contained to make debugging easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While rewriting the functions that required an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/code&gt; object I ran into the error below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;error: Cannot read property &#39;addEventListener&#39; of null&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that the function returned &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; because it executed before the DOM was fully loaded. I fixed this problem by adding &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onload&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;window.onload&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. MDN notes that “The &lt;strong&gt;load event&lt;/strong&gt; fires at the end of the document loading process. At this point, all of the objects in the document are in the DOM, and all the images, scripts, links and sub-frames have finished loading.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scope&quot;&gt;Scope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reminded a few times of the importance of understanding scope and how it can affect your code structure. I had to move functions around a bit to ensure that all of my variables were able to be accessed properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, I would get an error that a variable is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;. To fix this I’d either make the variable global or I would move the function to allow it access to that variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cors&quot;&gt;CORS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my biggest hurdle throughout this project. I spent several days reading about cross-origin resource sharing and trying several known hacks to enable CORS from the client side. I tried to manually &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;setRequestHeaders&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; within my xhr request, I tried to make my request using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plainjs.com/javascript/ajax/jsonp-ajax-requests-50/&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JSONP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method, and I even attempted to add CORS support from the server side. In the end, solving the problem was specific to the Wikipedia API and if I would have read the docs a bit more carefully I could have saved myself several days of headache. I am happy that I got such an in-depth lesson on how CORS works. I will also &lt;em&gt;ALWAYS&lt;/em&gt; read the docs thoroughly from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I probably spent more time than necessary banging my head up against the wall instead of just asking for help but I don’t think I will run into any of these problems in this manner again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My RC Start Experience</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-rc-start&quot;&gt;What is RC Start?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recurse Center describes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recurse.com/blog/99-free-one-on-one-mentorship-for-new-programmers&quot;&gt;RC Start&lt;/a&gt; as an experiment that “offers one-on-one advice from members of the Recurse Center community”. If you are selected for RC Start, you’ll get three 45-minute one-on-one sessions with an RC alum(in-person or video chat) and access to the RC Start community through a private forum (check out the link for more specifics).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-i-apply&quot;&gt;Why did I apply?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came across Recurse Center and RC Start, I had just started to become serious about teaching myself to code. I fell in love with RC’s mission and description of community and I immediately wanted to be apart of it. I had no previous coding background but I was eager to learn and I knew that having a mentor could help answer some of the questions that I’d been stuck on and help point me in the right direction. RC Start seemed like the perfect program from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-were-the-one-on-one-sessions-like&quot;&gt;What were the one-on-one sessions like?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, every RC Start experience is different based on schedules and other factors so my experience may not look like anyone else’s. Because I’ve been nomadic, I was paired with a remote mentor. When I began the program I was in Italy and my mentor was based in Singapore. Throughout the program, I went from Italy to France to Ireland so we always had a 6 or 7 hour time difference. This was not a  problem because I was flexible and she gave me plenty of options to meet. Our sessions were a bit spaced out for scheduling reasons but also to give me time in-between to implement what we talked about and learn on my own. In between each session, my mentor sent me resources and I sent her updates on my progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had 4 sessions total (1 intro and 3 official). Leading up to each session, I made notes about what I wanted to ask and/or work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introductory-session---june-11th-2016&quot;&gt;Introductory Session - June 11th, 2016&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this first session we learned a bit about one another, talked about what I have been working on and what I wanted out of our sessions. It was a great start to our journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;session-1---june-26th-2016&quot;&gt;Session 1 - June 26th, 2016&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our first official session she did a code review of my portfolio code, talked about DOM manipulation, and briefly talked about making art with code. She suggested that I look into image processing and other generative art because of my photography background. She also suggested Jekyll for my portfolio and urged me to get it online using gh-pages for practice with git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I learned how to use ‘ping’ using the terminal because our connection was lost a few times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;session-2---july-19-2016&quot;&gt;Session 2 - July 19, 2016&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading up to this session I wrote up my learning priorities and a list of specific questions about what I had been working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of this session we used screen sharing to walk through building a JavaScript carousel and she showed me examples of DOM Manipulation using JavaScript. This was the most helpful session up until this point. Hearing her talk through why she did certain things and about how she thought about the code solidified some of my understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this session I began building my own small JavaScript projects and finding real-world applications for the scripts that I was learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we talked about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;my newly published Jekyll site and issues I had faced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open source&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Git and Github (writing proper commit messages, git commands, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setting up a local server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;session-3---september-6th-2016&quot;&gt;Session 3 - September 6th, 2016&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our final session, we pair programmed on my local weather app. With my mentor’s help, I changed 2 jQuery scripts to plain JavaScript. In the process she also showed me several debugging techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, pairing showed me that I need to work on communicating more clearly (out loud and in real-time) what I am coding and what I don’t understand. This skill is necessary when working in groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was such a valuable experience and I can’t wait to pair more with other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience was overwhelmingly positive. I really loved my mentor and learned a ton from her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I would have down a few things differently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;been more active within the RC Start community (in the community forum)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;asked more questions in between sessions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;paired on all 3 sessions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;asked for more code reviews and specific feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Before This Year is Over</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I began learning to code seriously about 4 months ago. I have come amazingly far from not knowing exactly what computer programming was a year ago to today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what I would like to work on before 2016 is over&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;become-a-javascript-ninja&quot;&gt;Become a JavaScript Ninja&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I know enough JavaScript to be dangerous. I can write small programs and solve simple algorithms but anything bigger and I am off in Google land trying to figure out what I have gotten myself into. Here are some of the JS projects that I have worked on so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tanham.github.io/js-rocket/rocket.html&quot;&gt;JS Rocket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/tanham2122/pen/WxzBgE&quot;&gt;Random Quote Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/tanham2122/pen/kXJQzK&quot;&gt;Local Weather app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;JS Calculator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To Do List App&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that a few months is not enough time to become a JS expert but I plan to deeply study the fundamentals of JavaScript and how it works while writing an absurd amount of code. By the end of the year, I would like to have confidence that I can solve most things with JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan of attack is simple: write code, read code, read books, and talk JS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write code - write at least one JS app each week, write JS daily&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read code -  Periodically read JavaScript code (maybe in a pair or group?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reading list - Think Like a Programmer, Eloquent JavaScript, You Don’t Know JS, JavaScript: The Good Parts, (I am taking suggestions)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk JS - Ask questions, pontificate, teach what I know, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;build-a-body-of-art-work-using-code&quot;&gt;Build a Body of Art Work Using Code&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love art. I also love the idea using code to make art. CSS animation, image processing and other generative art fascinates me. I would like to spend time digging deeper into this kind of programming and making some of my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create 3-5 pieces of art with code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design and program a computer game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;build-an-app&quot;&gt;Build an App&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to build an app that keeps tracks of several kinds personal data in one place(i.e health metrics, finances, daily log, stress levels, food intake, etc.). On any given day, I would like to be able to analyze any week’s or month’s personal data to find areas of self-improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an extension of a self-experiment that I have been working on for some time. When I put all the important metrics in one place, I always find ways I can improve my quality of life so I would like to use software to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;also&quot;&gt;Also:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;find a community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;contribute to Open Source&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;feel confident when introducing myself as a web developer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>I Crave Community</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I crave community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past eight months, I have been traveling all around Europe, searching for my community. I have been to England, Spain, Italy, France, and Ireland and in each place I have found what I like to call the 5-percenters. People who beleive in pursuing dreams and travel and living life as loudly as possible. People who chose not to judge based on silly things like skin color and sexual orientation. People who actually want to know who you are. It’s been transformative. I’ve learned so much about this part of the world. I have so much more to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important lesson so far is that the most effective way to learn something is to surround myself with others who are just as passionate (about that something) as I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am looking for my code community. I am looking for people who love to code. I’d love to find those who may look a bit different than the traditional web developer. I’d love to spend hours a day with my new code community, working out problems and coming up with new ways of doing things. I’d love to dive right into the deep end and code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The search begins…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hacking my learning</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had to hack my learning. Over the past few weeks, I found that I wasn’t picking up JavaScript as well as I’d like with fCC. I got bored with tutorials and I figured out a pattern to solving problems by imitation rather then thinking through it. I am naturally a corner cutter and so without the fundamental understanding I flew through the material with patterns I picked up solving the easy stuff. For me to understand something I have to dig into what’s under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to fCC, I tried Codecademy, reading JavaScript books, looking at MDN and other online resources. Some stuff was boring and other stuff was incredibly dense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently had an ‘aha’ moment when my RC start mentor walked me through building a JavaScript image slider using Codepen and screen-casting. As she built the slider, I listened to her talk her way through why she did things. I am comfortable with JavaScript syntax but I usually get caught up in thinking computationally. It helped so much to hear her talk through her process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I am beginning to understand what’s most important to my learning. I need a fundamental understanding of concepts and I need interactive examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the right amount of community and self awareness pertaining to one’s learning style can save a ton of time and trouble learning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog Test!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;Tom&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;. If you have questions, you can ask them on &lt;a href=&quot;https://talk.jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll Talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
