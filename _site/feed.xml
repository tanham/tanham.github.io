        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Building This Jekyll Site</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;inspiration&quot;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing and building a new website for myself was the reason that I wanted to learn to code. I was so fed up with the free resources available to me (an at the time non-techie) and I wanted to learn to make my own website. I had no idea that I’d get so into it, but here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wire-framing&quot;&gt;Wire framing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m new to designing websites but I know what I like. I watched a few youtube videos about wire framing, with hopes of understanding the thought processes behind design and what things to take note of in the beginning. I kept my eyes open as I perused the web for designs that I liked and then I sketched a several designs over a few days. I nixed several ideas (some that I still like) because I just wasn’t sure. While learning something new in a self-directed environment sometimes difficult to know the right way to go. At this point, many of my ideas are a remix of some of the things that I admire online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prototyping-in-codepen&quot;&gt;Prototyping in Codepen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I coded 3 iterations of my design in Codepen to prototype. I like Codepen for it’s auto preview feature. I thought it might be nice to immediately see how my code came to life - and it was. I chose to use Bootstrap and Flexbox to create my layout fast. I already feel a few limitations here…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had plenty help every step of the way. For wire framing I watched a video from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQO47_AP6lo&quot;&gt;DevTip&lt;/a&gt; and bits and pieces of others to try to put myself on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lilchen.com/blog/site-redesign-process/&quot;&gt;Lil Chen’s site redesign article&lt;/a&gt; was such a big help in having a peak into how someone more experience may go about the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also read about writing clean and modular code with &lt;a href=&quot;http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/&quot;&gt;BEM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://toddmotto.com/getting-started-with-object-orientated-css-oocss-creating-a-button-kit/&quot;&gt;OOCSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://learnlayout.com/&quot;&gt;Learn layout&lt;/a&gt; was a good help for some CSS refreshers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp&quot;&gt;Minimum viable product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t say that I have hard fast followed any of these things I have to remind myself of the things that I learn and want to adopt at every turn but they serve as good jumping off points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enter-jekyll&quot;&gt;Enter Jekyll&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I downloaded and ran jekyll for the first time with the help of their amazing documentation - https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/. I decided to use the default Jekyll them as a starting point. I ran into several problems that I am still working out and in retrospect I should have began with a clean slate but working the kinks was a tremedous learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be continued…&lt;/p&gt;
