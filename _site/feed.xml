        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Building This Jekyll Site</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;inspiration&quot;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing and building a new website for myself was the reason that I wanted to learn to code. I was so fed up with the free resources available to me (an at the time non-techie) and I wanted to learn to make my own website. I had no idea that I’d get so into it, but here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wire-framing&quot;&gt;Wire framing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m new to designing websites but I know what I like. I watched a few Youtube videos about wire framing, with hopes of understanding some of the thought processes behind the practice and what things to take note of in the beginning. I kept my eyes open as I perused the web for designs that I liked and then I sketched a several designs over a few days. I nixed most of my initial ideas (some that I still like) because I didn’t think I could get it to work in the browser or because they were just bad. At this point, many of my ideas are a remix of some of the things that I admire online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prototyping-in-codepen&quot;&gt;Prototyping in Codepen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I coded 3 iterations of my design in Codepen to prototype. I like Codepen for it’s auto preview feature. I thought it might be nice to immediately see how my code came to life - and it was. I chose to use Bootstrap to create my layout fast. Here is one iteration of the design:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-height=&quot;265&quot; data-theme-id=&quot;0&quot; data-slug-hash=&quot;vKJOzQ&quot; data-default-tab=&quot;html,result&quot; data-user=&quot;tanham2122&quot; data-embed-version=&quot;2&quot; class=&quot;codepen&quot;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/tanham2122/pen/vKJOzQ/&quot;&gt;vKJOzQ&lt;/a&gt; by Tanisha Hampden (&lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/tanham2122&quot;&gt;@tanham2122&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io&quot;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had plenty help every step of the way. For wire framing I watched a video from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQO47_AP6lo&quot;&gt;DevTip&lt;/a&gt; and bits and pieces from others to try to put myself on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lilchen.com/blog/site-redesign-process/&quot;&gt;Lil Chen’s site redesign article&lt;/a&gt; was such a big help in having a peek into how someone more experienced may go about the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also read about writing clean and modular code with &lt;a href=&quot;http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/&quot;&gt;BEM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://toddmotto.com/getting-started-with-object-orientated-css-oocss-creating-a-button-kit/&quot;&gt;OOCSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://learnlayout.com/&quot;&gt;Learn layout&lt;/a&gt; was a good help for some CSS refreshers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp&quot;&gt;Minimum viable product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t say that I have hard fast followed any of these things I have to remind myself of the things that I learn and want to adopt at every turn but they serve as good jumping off points. I will say that at some point I had to stop trying to take advice and just code. The resources were great to get me started but I had to dig in before analysis paralysis set in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enter-jekyll&quot;&gt;Enter Jekyll&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I downloaded and ran Jekyll for the first time with the help of their amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to use the default Jekyll theme as a starting point. I ran into several problems that I am still working out and in retrospect I should have began with a clean slate but working the kinks was a tremendous learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem that I had was using vanilla CSS instead of Sass. The default Jekyll theme comes with Sass styling. I pasted my CSS into a new file and added to the project - the Sass styling and my CSS was competing with each other. I liked some of the Sass styling but I ended up deleting the entire Sass files so I can have full control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still learning Jekyll and I’m constantly amazed by how powerful it is. My design and overall website will continue to evolve as I learn and experiment more.&lt;/p&gt;
