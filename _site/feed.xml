        <title>I Crave Community</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I crave community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past eight months, I have been traveling all around Europe, searching for my community. I have been to England, Spain, Italy, France, and Ireland and in each place I have found what I like to call the 5-percenters. People who beleive in pursuing dreams and travel and living life as loudly as possible. People who chose not to judge based on silly things like skin color and sexual orientation. People who actually want to know who you are. It’s been transformative. I’ve learned so much about this part of the world. I have so much more to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important lesson so far is that the most effective way to learn something is to surround myself with others who are just as passionate (about that something) as I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am looking for my code community. I am looking for people who love to code. I’d love to find those who may look a bit different than the traditional web developer. I’d love to spend hours a day with my new code community, working out problems and coming up with new ways of doing things. I’d love to dive right into the deep end and code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The search begins…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hacking my learning</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had to hack my learning. Over the past few weeks, I found that I wasn’t picking up JavaScript as well as I’d like with fCC. I got bored with tutorials and I figured out a pattern to solving problems by imitation rather then thinking through it. I am naturally a corner cutter and so without the fundamental understanding I flew through the material with patterns I picked up solving the easy stuff. For me to understand something I have to dig into what’s under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to fCC, I tried Codecademy, reading JavaScript books, looking at MDN and other online resources. Some stuff was boring and other stuff was incredibly dense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently had an ‘aha’ moment when my RC start mentor walked me through building a JavaScript image slider using Codepen and screen-casting. As she built the slider, I listened to her talk her way through why she did things. I am comfortable with JavaScript syntax but I usually get caught up in thinking computationally. It helped so much to hear her talk through her process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I am beginning to understand what’s most important to my learning. I need a fundamental understanding of concepts and I need interactive examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the right amount of community and self awareness pertaining to one’s learning style can save a ton of time and trouble learning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog Test!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;Tom&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;.

        <title>Code Goals</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to create a public record my goals and learning strategy to hold myself accountable and to share more of my journey. To help measure my progress I will keep this page active by adding links to my code and sharing adjustments that I make. Here are the 5 things that I am focusing on over the next three months:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-stuff&quot;&gt;Building stuff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This portfolio site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CS50 psets
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;pset 0 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/117240207/&quot;&gt;MIT Scratch project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;pset 1 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/tanham/0f614de419354df1afd946c57d480fe4&quot;&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/tanham/5cc739d58d8f3619177d8192fcbf3d19&quot;&gt;Mario&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;pset 2&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;pset 3&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;pset 4&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;pset 5&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;pset 6&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;pset 7&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;pset 8&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fCC projects
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/tanham2122/pen/WxzBgE&quot;&gt;Random Quote Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Local Weather App&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Wikipedia Viewer&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Twitch.tv JSON api&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CSS animation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vanilla Javascript features&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jekyll themes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/collection/XRRQzY/&quot;&gt;Codepen reference pens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tanham21.github.io/js-rocket/rocket.html&quot;&gt;JS Rocket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deep-learning-front-end-resources&quot;&gt;Deep Learning (Front-end Resources)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edx.org/&quot;&gt;edX CS50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.com/tanham21&quot;&gt;freeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/&quot;&gt;Mozilla Developer Network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecmascript.org/docs.php&quot;&gt;EMCAscript standard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gitbook.com/book/frontendmasters/front-end-handbook/details&quot;&gt;Front End Handbook pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;writing&quot;&gt;Writing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a goal to post at least weekly to this blog. I’d like to write about things that I have learned, problems that I encounter and other tech related (and non-related) things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;community&quot;&gt;Community&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part I am learning alone, just me and my computer. Because I am currently traveling, language barriers and location make it so I am rarely able to attend meetups or meet other Devs in real life. To hack this I am apart of a few online groups that focus on creating community for people like me. I am also apart of Recurse center’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recurse.com/blog/99-free-one-on-one-mentorship-for-new-programmers&quot;&gt;RC start program&lt;/a&gt; so I have access to a mentor and that community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still learning how to use these communities as resources and help wherever I can but I’d like to make this a big part of my learning and overall coding journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-source&quot;&gt;Open Source&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very interested in Open Source. I’ve already benefited tremendously from OSS and I would like to contribute. I believe in making technology accessible and I think it is a great way to give back to a community that has already taught me so much. Over the next three months I will pick an open source project to contribute to regularly. I will updated this post with my progress.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Building This Jekyll Site</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;inspiration&quot;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing and building a new website for myself was the reason that I wanted to learn to code. I was so fed up with the free resources available to me (an at the time non-techie) and I wanted to learn to make my own website. I had no idea that I’d get so into it, but here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wire-framing&quot;&gt;Wire framing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m new to designing websites but I know what I like. I watched a few Youtube videos about wire framing, with hopes of understanding some of the thought processes behind the practice and what things to take note of in the beginning. I kept my eyes open as I perused the web for designs that I liked and then I sketched a several designs over a few days. I nixed most of my initial ideas (some that I still like) because I didn’t think I could get it to work in the browser or because they were just bad. At this point, many of my ideas are a remix of some of the things that I admire online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prototyping-in-codepen&quot;&gt;Prototyping in Codepen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I coded 3 iterations of my design in Codepen to prototype. I like Codepen for it’s auto preview feature. I thought it might be nice to immediately see how my code came to life - and it was. I chose to use Bootstrap to create my layout fast. Here is one iteration of the design:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-height=&quot;265&quot; data-theme-id=&quot;0&quot; data-slug-hash=&quot;vKJOzQ&quot; data-default-tab=&quot;html,result&quot; data-user=&quot;tanham2122&quot; data-embed-version=&quot;2&quot; class=&quot;codepen&quot;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/tanham2122/pen/vKJOzQ/&quot;&gt;vKJOzQ&lt;/a&gt; by Tanisha Hampden (&lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/tanham2122&quot;&gt;@tanham2122&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io&quot;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had plenty help every step of the way. For wire framing I watched a video from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQO47_AP6lo&quot;&gt;DevTip&lt;/a&gt; and bits and pieces from others to try to put myself on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lilchen.com/blog/site-redesign-process/&quot;&gt;Lil Chen’s site redesign article&lt;/a&gt; was such a big help in having a peek into how someone more experienced may go about the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also read about writing clean and modular code with &lt;a href=&quot;http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/&quot;&gt;BEM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://toddmotto.com/getting-started-with-object-orientated-css-oocss-creating-a-button-kit/&quot;&gt;OOCSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://learnlayout.com/&quot;&gt;Learn layout&lt;/a&gt; was a good help for some CSS refreshers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp&quot;&gt;Minimum viable product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t say that I have hard fast followed any of these things. I have to remind myself of the things that I learn and want to adopt at every turn but they serve as good jumping off points. I will say that at some point I had to stop trying to take advice and just code. The resources were great to get me started but I had to dig in before analysis paralysis set in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enter-jekyll&quot;&gt;Enter Jekyll&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I downloaded and ran Jekyll for the first time with the help of their amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to use the default Jekyll theme as a starting point. I ran into several problems that I am still working out and in retrospect I should have began with a clean slate but working the kinks was a tremendous learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem that I had was using vanilla CSS instead of Sass. The default Jekyll theme comes with Sass styling. I pasted my CSS into a new file and added to the project - the Sass styling and my CSS was competing with each other. I liked some of the Sass styling but I ended up deleting the entire Sass files so I can have full control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still learning Jekyll and I’m constantly amazed by how powerful it is. My design and overall website will continue to evolve as I learn and experiment more.&lt;/p&gt;
