          <p>I make things with <a href src="#">cameras</a>, <a href src="#"> words</a>, and <a href src="#">code</a>. I am interested in storytelling, travel, and self-improvement. At the moment, I am slow traveling through Europe and learning Javascript.
            Have a look at what I am currently <a href="now.html">working on</a>.</p>

          <p>As a photographer (and a web developer), I have no formal training other than workshops and online resources. What I do have is an urge to understand myself and my surroundings, a never-ending curiosity, and a burning passion to create.</p>
